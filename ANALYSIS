TP4056 - charger

input voltage 4 to 8v

if battery < 2.9, trickle charge
then regular charge until current < 10% of programmed val or over 4.2v
after falling to 4.05, start charging again

DW01 - protection
abs max vcc 10v
overcharge protection 4.25
overcharge release 4.05
overdischarge protection 2.4
overdischarge release 3

overcurrent: stops when the drop across the 2 fets is more than 150 mV.
current = .15 / Rds*2

max rds at high temp is 35 milliohm * 1.2 (for temp) = 42, to current
would be .15 / (2*.042) = 1.7 amps.

at typical and low temp: .15/(2* .021) = 3.5 amps

at low temp and min Rds, say 10 milliohm:
.15 / (2*.010) = 7.5 amps

example battery internal resistance <= 160 miliohm
at 2.4 volts, a short gives 15 amps

worst case internal resistance 2 ohms
at 2.4 volts, short gives 1.2 amps
